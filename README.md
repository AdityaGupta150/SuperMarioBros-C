SuperMarioBros-C
================

An attempt to manually translate the original Super Mario Bros. for the NES to readable C/C++

Compiling
---------

Currently, the code only compiles with a C++11 compatible compiler due to the emulation core used.

Additionally, SDL2 is required for video/input functionality.

A Code::Blocks project file has been provided for convenience, and it is what is currently used for development.

Running
-------

This requires an *unmodified* copy of the `Super Mario Bros. (JU) (PRG0) [!].nes` ROM in the working directory to run.
